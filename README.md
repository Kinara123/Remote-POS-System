Remote POS Description
The Remote Point of Sale (POS) Security Monitoring System is a robust security solution designed to safeguard transaction integrity in distributed retail environments. The system employs a layered security model that integrates IP address whitelisting, geolocation detection, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users at approved physical locations can access the system.

The authentication process begins by requiring users to enable location services on their devices. This step allows the system to capture both the public IP address and geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the login attempt. The system compares these values against a pre-defined set of authorized IPs and geographic boundaries. If the login request originates outside of the authorized region or from an unrecognized IP, access is immediately denied.

Upon successful location validation, the user must complete a multi-factor authentication procedure involving:

A password (knowledge factor),

A One-Time Password (OTP) sent to the registered device (possession factor),

A CAPTCHA test to distinguish humans from bots (cognitive/human verification layer).

This multi-layered approach mitigates risks such as credential theft, phishing attacks, and unauthorized remote access by verifying not only who the user is, but also where they are physically located.

The system is designed to ensure compliance with data protection standards such as PCI DSS and the Kenya Data Protection Act. Real-time alerts and activity logs enhance transparency and allow administrators to respond quickly to suspicious behavior. The platform is accessible via a user-friendly web interface and supports secure integration with existing POS infrastructure, making it a scalable and effective security enhancement for modern retail operations.
